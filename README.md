# Ecommerce
Java and HTML based e commerce website
This project is a web-based e-commerce application developed to provide an online shopping platform where users can browse products, add items to a cart, and place orders.

The application is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and interactive user interface. It works like a single-page application (SPA), meaning users can perform actions like adding products to the cart without reloading the page.
